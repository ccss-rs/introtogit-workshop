# Introduction to Git

This workshop will help get you started with Git. This tool helps track changes made in project documents such as program files or source codes, effectively versioning them and allowing teams to collaborate via a central repository hub such as Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab. This workshop covers configuring and initializing a git repository; editing, staging, and committing files; branching and retrieving previous versions of files; and setting up a repository on Github for individual or project team collaboration.

There will be hands-on exercises using git and Github. This workshop will be taught via the command line using Git Bash.  All of you received an e-mail yesterday with instructions to download and install the latest version of git, create a Github account, and download the training materials, including the handout.  The handout contains the step-by-step guide to the workshop.  We will go through each step, which is numbered for easy reference.  I will explain each step, demonstrate it, then let you do it.  I designed the handout so that you can review what you have learned in this workshop or do the workshop on your own and at your own pace.
